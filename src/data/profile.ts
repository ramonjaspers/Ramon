  about: `I am a result driven developer with more than eight years of expertise in creating and delivering scalable web and mobile solutions. Currently I am driving FM Group their digital transformation as a Lead Developer. For which I designed and created design systems, component libraries and company-wide frontend standards. Next to greenfield experience I am comfortable with legacy projects lifting them to modern standards like converting JS code to TS, Redux to RTK or ReactQuery and RN projects to Expo. 
  
I am a real people person and prefer face to face contact. In my freetime I like go to the theater 🎭, bake something sweet 🥧, go for a hike 🏞️, do a little gaming now and then ♟️, go to the gym 🏋️, do some socializing 🍺, tinker on my motorcycle 🏍️ and pretend to be bob the builder; renovating my house 🔨👷.`,

At the same time I improved the general way of working at FM with shorter sprints, better artifact usage, implementing ticket templates and trying to just work out what the end-user really wants minimizing assumptions.',
